  <h2>Engineer Profile</h2>
  <pre>
Dear {{Hiring Manager / Team}},

I am writing to express my interest in the {{position title}} role at {{Company}}.  
Though I come from a non-traditional path, I have built several production-level projects that show my capacity to design, implement, and deliver robust systems:

- A full-stack headless CMS platform (Django Wagtail + Next.js) used for inclusive language publishing (fommes.org).  
- A rehabilitation support Progressive Web App with secure session flows, gamified user profiles, and multilingual support.  
- A multiplayer Unity card game with server-authoritative architecture and extensible backend integration.  

My approach emphasizes modular architecture, secure data handling, and clarity in bridging design with code. I thrive in environments where problems are not yet fully defined and solutions must be iterated quickly.  

I would be excited to bring this mindset and technical versatility to {{Company}}, and I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills could contribute to your team.  

Sincerely,  
Yariv Friedman
