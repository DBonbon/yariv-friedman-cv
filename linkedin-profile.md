About
What do a lawyer, a documentary filmmaker, and a full-stack developer have in common? A relentless curiosity about the systems that shape our world.

My journey has been anything but linear. I started in law, understanding rules and structures. Then, as a filmmaker, I learned to tell human stories, culminating in a documentary about the search for the Higgs Boson at CERN. Today, as a creative technologist, I build the systems I once only observed.

I thrive on prototyping complex ideas into tangible solutions. Whether it's building a Django + Next.js CMS, developing a progressive web app for rehabilitation, or architecting a multiplayer game in Unity, my focus is always on the 'why'. Why does this matter? Who does it serve? How can we make it better?

I'm passionate about sharing what I learn and am currently exploring [mention 1-2 specific interests, e.g., "the applications of generative AI in education" or "building more inclusive digital spaces"]. I believe the best technology is a bridge—connecting ideas to reality, and people to solutions.

If you're excited by the intersection of technology, creativity, and human-centered design, let's connect!
