version 1:
I’m a creative technologist with a multidisciplinary background in law, documentary filmmaking, and now full-stack programming. Over the last years I’ve built projects ranging from CMS platforms (Django + Next.js), to a rehabilitation PWA, to a Unity multiplayer game. My strength is identifying underlying patterns across disciplines and prototyping systems that unify complex elements into working solutions.

I thrive where creativity meets engineering — building tools and experiences that serve real human needs.

version 2:
I create bridges in complex endpoints, building systems that evolve with solid architecture.
I code with clarity, curiosity, and rigor, crafting organic structures that both enhance action and inspire it.
From law and documentary film to software and game design, my path reflects a single thread: translating complexity into accessible, working solutions.
Today I apply that mindset to full-stack development, real-time multiplayer systems, and mission-driven platforms — bringing ideas into life through code.
