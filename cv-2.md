### **Selected Projects & Technical Leadership**

**`fommes` | Founder & Lead Architect**

A global digital platform designed to catalyze the worldwide adoption of gender-free language by providing the tools (Means), educational content (Motive), and collaborative space (Opportunity) for communities to drive linguistic innovation.

*   Architected a sophisticated headless system using **Python (Wagtail)** for the backend and **Next.js** for the frontend, deployed with a modern **Docker**-based workflow.
*   Translated a unique behavioral change model (**MMO: Means-Motive-Opportunity**) into a tangible and engaging user experience.
*   Engineered an advanced, maintainable frontend design system based on **spacing-agnostic components** to ensure long-term scalability and reusability.

**`netcode04` | Lead Developer & Architect**

A multiplayer educational game platform in **Unity/C#** designed to facilitate second-language acquisition through social gameplay, implemented as a 2-4 player "Quartets" card game.

*   Engineered a fully **server-authoritative** system using **Unity's Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)** to ensure cheat-free, reliable, and secure gameplay.
*   Designed a sophisticated **five-layer player object model** in C# that cleanly separates data, runtime state, game logic, network synchronization, and UI for high maintainability.
*   Created a modular, data-driven architecture using JSON for game content and an efficient UI pooling system for dynamic and responsive rendering across multiple platforms (WebGL, Windows, Linux).

**`Wagtail-Teki` | Architect & Core Contributor**

A production-ready, open-source boilerplate for building scalable, secure, and high-performance headless websites.

*   Designed and implemented the core decoupled architecture using **Django/Wagtail** as a headless CMS and **Next.js/React** for the frontend.
*   Integrated a modern DevOps workflow with **Docker** for local development, **Ansible** for deployment, and pre-configured **CI/CD** pipelines.
*   Engineered a flexible and robust foundation that has been adopted by other developers as a "war-machine" for building complex, content-driven web applications.

### **Multidisciplinary Foundation**

My background in international law and documentary filmmaking provides a unique foundation for my work as a systems architect, honing my ability to manage complexity, lead diverse teams, and deliver high-stakes projects.

*   **Documentary Filmmaker & Director:** Independently produced and directed a feature film broadcast on major European networks, demonstrating mastery in a competitive field, leadership of creative and technical teams, and the ability to distill highly complex subjects (the discovery of the Higgs boson) into a compelling narrative.
*   **International Lawyer (IOM, Geneva):** Practiced law in a high-stakes environment, cultivating exceptional analytical rigor and systemic problem-solving skills by navigating complex international legal frameworks.
*   **Recognition for Conceptual Insight:** My ability to distill complex topics was recognized by the scientific community when a leading CERN physicist quoted my formulation to conclude a 2017 scientific address on the Higgs boson discovery: *"The act of discovery is basically what creates the unknown."*
