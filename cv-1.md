Yariv Friedman â€“ CV
ðŸ§­ Profile

Autoâ€‘didact creative technologist and systems thinker with a multidisciplinary background spanning law, film, interactive media, and in recent years, software development. I code, solve hard problems, and get my hands dirty, while excelling as a technical generalist and integrator â€” bridging art, logic, and code to create coherent, scalable systems. Fluent in the languages of diverse specialists, I manage complex data flows and translate between creative and technical teams.

More than coordinating teams or linking disciplines, I identify the deeper structures that unify diverse parts of a system. This lets me analyze complexity, extract shared principles, and design streamlined prototypes that turn disparate elements into a coherent working unit.

My strength lies in mediating complexity, aligning multiple perspectives into a unified, functional vision. Best suited for roles that demand crossâ€‘disciplinary collaboration, rapid prototyping, and systems integration.

ðŸ§© Personal Background

Studied Law and Economics at Tel Aviv University.
Worked as a lawyer at the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Geneva.
Later became a documentary filmmaker â€” my film Dialogues with a Lonely Man follows the scientists behind the discovery of the Higgs boson (Nobel Prize 2013) and was shown on major networks across Europe.
I transitioned into programming via Blender, where building animation logic sparked a deeper curiosity about systems and tools.
